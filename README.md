# Non-Statistical Entropy

The concept of entropy, since its introduction by Clausius and through its subsequent development via Boltzmann's statistical interpretation and Shannon's information theory, has never fully escaped the framework of probability theory. This has rendered entropy a kind of "statistical summary" of a system's final state, incapable of revealing its specific evolution within microscopic dynamical processes. As early as 1901, Max Planck presciently called for finding an analytic expression for entropy, one that could be precisely calculated and tracked like a classical physical quantity.

This vision now finds a potent response. In the paper "Non-Statistical Analytic Entropy," the author proposes a novel "multiplicative entropy," whose core premise is to directly use the uniformity of the energy distribution within a closed, quantized, and topologically invariant network of space elementary quanta as the analytic definition of entropy. This entropy is defined as the product of the energies of all fundamental units in the system: S = Π mᵢ. Here, mᵢ is the energy carried by each spatial quantum, quantized in units of Planck's constant *h*.
